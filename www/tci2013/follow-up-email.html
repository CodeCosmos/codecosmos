<h1>Thanks for taking my coding course!</h1>

<p>
Last week you were part of the first group to take a course using
CodeCosmos, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed teaching it!
I'd love to hear more about what you liked most, and what you think
I can improve on for future courses. If you have any feedback,
questions, want any advice, etc. just email me at
<a href="mailto:bob@redivi.com">bob@redivi.com</a> and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can. I really am interested in helping you
all out, and I'll make the time to do it even though I'm a few
thousand miles away here in San Francisco.
</p>

<h2>T-Shirts</h2>

<p>
To finish up your t-shirt or poster projects, you should be able to 
login at <a href="http://codecosmos.com/">codecosmos.com</a>.
When you have a design that you're ready to print, just email me the
code. I'll have to do a little work on my end to translate the code
into a form that's suitable for printing (a higher quality output than
Processing.js, basically), and then I'll get back to you as soon as I
can with a couple options for you to choose from (t-shirt sizes,
colors, etc.). If you'd like a poster instead of a shirt, let me know.
If you think what you've made is really cool, I'd be happy to help
you set up an online shop to sell your designs.
</p>

<p>
I know I owe a few of you advice on how to tweak what you have so
far, and I'll be getting to that real soon. That's next on my list!
</p>

<h2>What you learned</h2>

<p>
You spent a week programming in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
programming language, which is a professional programming language that
people get paid to write code in. JavaScript is most commonly used by
web developers to make web pages interactive. If you've used Facebook,
Twitter, Google, Gmail, Yahoo, or any basically any other popular
website you've used code that was written in JavaScript. JavaScript is
becoming popular even outside of the web browser, so becoming
familiar with it is a very useful computer skill.
</p>

<p>
The code you wrote was all in JavaScript, but you were using the
<a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a> library for all of
the projects. If you had a lot of fun with the kind of code that we were
writing, I'd suggest taking a closer look at Processing.js, and also
<a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, which is the
desktop programming language that Processing.js is based on.
The Processing language is mostly used by artists and designers,
but the concepts you'll learn are very applicable to other fields.
</p>

<p>
It might not have seemed like it, but the computer science and math
you were using in the lab are actually quite advanced!
</p>

<p>
Here's a short
list of what I can think of off the top of my head:
<dl>
  <dt>Coordinate Geometry</dt>
  <dd>Drawing lines and shapes on our canvas is an application of coordinate
  geometry. Basically, all of computer graphics relies heavily on
  coordinate geometry.</dd>
  <dt>Linear Algebra</dt>
  <dd>While we weren't explicitly treating the x and y components of
  our coordinates as column vectors, we really were doing a lot of
  linear algebra. Again, pretty much all of computer graphics sits on
  top of linear algebra, and you were implementing a lot of this stuff
  on your own, instead of relying on higher-level vector operations!
  Any time we were manipulating the transformation matrix, whether
  with translate, rotate, or scale, we were using linear algebra to do
  an affine transformation of the coordinate system. Sounds pretty
  advanced, but not too hard for you all!</dd>
  <dt>Physics &amp; Euler Integration</dt>
  <dd>When you made that ball bounce with simulated gravity, that was
    a simulation of some basic Newtonian Physics using Euler's Method,
    which is something you might learn more about in a college-level
    differential equations course.</dd>
  <dt>Variables, Functions, Conditionals and Recursion</dt>
  <dd>In Computer Science, these are some of the trickiest concepts
    to get a handle on when you're starting out!</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h2>Where to learn more</h2>

<p>If you're interested to learn more, there's a TON of free content
available for you to learn from online! I'd also be happy to help
you along the way, whether you're struggling with a
particular concept or just need some help finding what you want.</p>

<p>Here are some of my favorites:
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a></dt>
<dd>Great basic programming content. Their
  environment is very similar to CodeCosmos (but more polished and
  easier to use!). Their "expert" level is certainly below college
  level, but it's a great place to start.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a></dt>
<dd>More great basic programming content. Their stuff is more
  practical than Khan Academy. You can learn how to make interactive
  web pages, and they have some tracks for server-side programming
  languages too. More vocational than college level computer science,
  but another great place to start.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a></dt>
<dd>College-level courses at your own pace. I highly recommend
  taking a good look here, there are some really fantastic
  courses. I've taken a few myself, such as
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs373">Artificial Intelligence for Robotics</a>
  and 
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs291">Interactive 3D Graphics</a>.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a></dt>
<dd>The downside is that the courses have a fixed
  schedule, but there is some great content here from beginner to grad
  school level. I'd probably save Coursera for last, as their focus seems
  to be more about theory than practice. I've taken a number of these
  myself
  (<a href="http://bob.ippoli.to/archives/2013/05/07/great-coursera-courses/">Five
  great Computer Science courses on Coursera</a>).</dd>

watch them again, here's a list of what I showed in class.</p>
